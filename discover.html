            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>My decision to choose the University of Minnesota Duluth was an easy one, because it's the kind of place where I can really see myself growing—both in the classroom and outside of it. The Business Analytics program caught my attention right away because it blends my interest in business with my love for problem-solving and data. I like that UMD focuses on hands-on learning, so I'll get real experience working with numbers, trends, and strategies that make an impact.</p>
                <p>What really makes UMD stand out for me is the atmosphere. The campus has this close-knit, welcoming vibe, and being surrounded by the natural beauty of Duluth makes it easy to stay balanced and inspired. Between the great professors, the supportive community, and the chance to study something I'm genuinely passionate about, choosing UMD just felt right.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The University's commitment to innovation and hands-on learning experiences perfectly aligned with my academic goals. The smaller class sizes and direct access to professors were major factors in my decision, as they ensure more personalized attention and better learning opportunities.</p>
            <p>Additionally, UMD's strong connections with industry partners and excellent career placement rates made it an ideal choice for building my future career path.</p>

                    <h3>Canal Park</h3>
                    <p>One of my favorite things to do in Duluth is waking up early to catch the sunrise in Canal Park. The sky over Lake Superior turns this mix of orange, pink, and purple, and the sound of the waves hitting the rocks is meditative. It's become something I do to help clear my mind and reminds me why I chose to live and study here.</p>

                    <p>During the summer, the Lakewalk is one of my favorite places to go relax. I love walking along the path while watching ships come into the harbor. On warm evenings, there's often live music playing somewhere nearby, and the air smells like lake breeze and food from Canal Park restaurants. It's the perfect way to end a day, simple, peaceful, and uniquely Duluth.</p>

                <div class="experience-card">
                    <h3>Superior Hiking Trail</h3>
                    <p>The first time I hiked the Superior Hiking Trail, I wasn't fully prepared for how beautiful some parts would be. The view from the top overlooking the lake is unreal, it feels like standing on the edge of the world. I go and hike it every chance I get, usually with friends, and every trip brings something new, different weather, new wildlife, or just that quiet peace you can't find anywhere else.</p>

                <div class="experience-card">
                    <h3>Spirit Mountain</h3>
                    <p>As someone who loves skiing, Spirit Mountain quickly became one of my favorite spots. It's just minutes from campus, and it's perfect for unwinding after a long week. Some of my best memories are night skiing under the lights with friends, followed by grabbing food downtown. It's one of those classic Duluth experiences that makes winter something to look forward to!</p>
